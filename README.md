# CovidProtocol
In this project we will create a IOT based system where we will be adding three important features which will help the system to perform as a covid-19 protocol security system at the entrance. Wherever we go, at the present covid-19 situation we face 2 major checking  1. Are we wearing Proper Face Mask  2. Do we have a Normal Body temperature If both condition satisfies we are given some sanitizers and sanitize our hands before getting in.  Hence Here we will be making a system which will perform this 3 tasks automatically. Hence, at first we will be making a contactless Thermal Gun to get the body temperature, with the help of MLX90614 Contactless Infrared Temperature Sensor with a microcontroller. Then we proceed for the last step that is sanitizing part with the help of a microcontroller and a ultrasonic or infrared IR Sensor. And both will be linked with our Python OpenCV Face Mask Detection.
